# Machine-Learning-Resources
Machine Learning pathway from beginning to advanced level. I am curating a list of resources that I am going to follow to pursue my path into ML.  
_Please feel free to contribute and suggest anything that adds value to the list!_  
_I will be updating the list when and when I get time. At present it is concurrent until Deep Learning_

Though it is not required to complete the courses in the following order, it is highly recommended to go top-down approach. There are lots of faster and hands-on approached courses out there. But I am completely into building strong foundations and gaining strong hold onto the subject. Hence, the courses will be both theoretical and practical (hands-on).

Mathematics can be concurrently done with Programming if you are comfortable with the material.

## Beginning from Math for ML
Since, math is a pre-requisite, we shall start with it.

To begin with, we shall have a basic intuition from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw):

- [ ] [Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
- [ ] [Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

### A deeper dive into mathematics:

- [ ] [Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/)
- [ ] [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)
- [ ] [Multivariable calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/)
- [ ] [Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/)

## Programming tutorials in Python

- [ ] [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm)
- [ ] [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm)
- [ ] [Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/index.htm)

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning

- [ ] [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/105/106105152/)
- [ ] [Deep Learning - Part 1](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/106/106106184/)
- [ ] [Deep Learning - Part 2](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/106/106106201/)
- [ ] While doing the above it is recommended to practice from [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
- [ ] [Practical Machine Learning with TensorFlow](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/106/106106213/)

## Additional Resources
